These python scripts format and modify the timeseries for hydro inflow using ENTSO-E Hydropower modelling data (PECD). 

Tested with python 3.10.4.

## Usage

In order to create timeseries for hydro inflow run Inflow_timeseries.py. It executes the python files in src-folder.

Files in src-folder can be also executed separately in case intermediate results are needed. Inflow_timeseries.py deletes all the intermediate results after usage.

## Input

From https://zenodo.org/record/3985078#.YgUKvurP2Ul: PECD-hydro-weekly-inflows.csv and PECD-hydro-daily-ror-generation.csv

## Src

QueryInflow.py

Generates area-specific timeseries files including parameters reservoir, psOpen and ror into areas-folder. Data is gathered from PECD-hydro-weekly-inflows.csv and PECD-hydro-daily-ror-generation.csv. Inside the python-file Start and End values can be changed to modify the timeframe for produced timeseries.

SummarizeInflows.py

Combines area-specific timeseries into summary_hydro_inflow_1982-2020_1h_MWh.csv. Inside the python-file Start and End values can be changed to modify the timeframe for produced timeseries.

AverageInflows.py

Creates 10%,50%,90% timeseries for one year from years in files generated by QueryInflow.py.


## Output

summary_hydro_inflow_1982-2020_1h_MWh.csv,summary_hydro_average_year_1982-2020_1h_MWh.csv
